import torch
import subprocess
import feedparser
from newspaper import Article
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Iterable
import instructor
import json
import cohere
import requests
from pydub import AudioSegment
from elevenlabs import Voice, VoiceSettings
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

# Download the 'punkt' tokenizer for NLTK
nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)

# Check if CUDA is available for GPU acceleration
print("CUDA is available." if torch.cuda.is_available() else "CUDA is not available. Using CPU.")

# Set up environment variables
os.environ["CO_API_KEY"] = "Enter your Cohere API Key"
os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"] = "Enter your Eleven Labs API Key"
```

*Ensuring your environment is correctly set up is crucial for the seamless execution of your podcast generation pipeline.*

## 2. Fetching and Summarizing News for RSS to Podcast Conversion

### Start with a Thought-Invoking Hook

*Statistics show that over 60% of users prefer consuming news through audio formats. Let's tap into this trend by fetching and summarizing the latest news for our AI-generated podcasts.*

### Retrieve Recent Articles from RSS Feeds

Create functions to retrieve and summarize articles from RSS feeds:

```python
def is_recent(pub_date, days=1):
    """
    Check if the article is recent (within specified days).
    
    Args:
    pub_date (str): Publication date of the article
    days (int): Number of days to consider as recent (default is 1)
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the article is recent, False otherwise
    """
    try:
        article_date = datetime.strptime(pub_date, "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z")
        return datetime.now(article_date.tzinfo) - article_date <= timedelta(days=days)
    except ValueError:
        return False

def get_recent_articles(rss_url, days=1):
    """
    Get recent articles from the RSS feed.
    
    Args:
    rss_url (str): URL of the RSS feed
    days (int): Number of days to consider as recent (default is 1)
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of tuples containing recent article titles and links
    """
    feed = feedparser.parse(rss_url)
    return [(entry.title, entry.link) for entry in feed.entries if is_recent(entry.published, days)]
```

### Extract Summaries

Use `newspaper3k` to extract summaries:

```python
def extract_summary(url):
    """
    Generate a summary of the article using newspaper3k.
    
    Args:
    url (str): URL of the article
    
    Returns:
    str: A summary of the article
    """
    article = Article(url)
    article.download()
    article.parse()
    article.nlp()
    return article.summary

def combine_summaries(rss_url, days=1):
    """
    Create summaries for recent articles.
    
    Args:
    rss_url (str): URL of the RSS feed
    days (int): Number of days to consider as recent (default is 1)
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries containing article titles and summaries
    """
    articles = get_recent_articles(rss_url, days)
    return [{
        "title": title,
        "summary": extract_summary(url)
    } for title, url in articles]
```

*These functions ensure you process only the latest and most relevant news articles, setting a solid foundation for your podcast.*

## 3. Generating Podcast Scripts with AI: Cohere Integration

### Main Content Hook

*Converting summaries into conversational scripts can dramatically increase listener engagement. Let's explore how to use AI to automate this process.*

### Set Up Cohere Client and Define Script Model

```python
# Initialize a client using the instructor library with Cohere's API
client = instructor.from_cohere(
    cohere.Client(api_key=os.environ["CO_API_KEY"]),
    max_tokens=500,
    model="command-r-plus",
)

# Define a Pydantic model for the podcast script
class PodcastScript(BaseModel):
    persona: str = Field(description="host")
    text: List[str] = Field(description="Podcast script lines")
    voice: str = Field(description="Ruth")
```

### Create Prompt Template and Generate Script

```python
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = Template("""
SUMMARY:
{{ combined_summary }}
TASK:
You are a JSON podcast generator and given the following news summary, you must create a human-like,
informal, friendly podcast episode for The World Today talk show. The episode should discuss the content of the news articles,
based on their importance.
You must follow the following instructions:
- There must be only one persona, the host, discussing the news.
- The host welcomes the audience and introduces the topics.
- The host discusses the news articles in an educational manner.
- All the communication should be in an informal tone, yet respectful.
- Avoid using specific onomatopoeias or funny expressions such as shrugs, gasps, tsk, laughs, etc. Stick to clear and straightforward dialogue.
- Do not include code in your conversation; explain the concepts in a human-friendly manner.
- Maintain a casual tone, avoiding corporate or commercial language while being respectful.
- Refrain from referencing outside sources unless mentioned in the combined summary.
- At the end of the podcast, the host should thank the audience and close the episode with a friendly goodbye message.
Instructions for generating the podcast:
- You are required to write the script for the podcast.
- The output must be a structured JSON array.
- There is 1 voice available, 'Ruth', which you must associate with the persona.

IMPORTANT: The ONLY output of this request should be a valid JSON array, with NO additional text, comments, or characters outside the JSON structure.
""".strip())

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def generate_podcast_script(combined_summary):
    """Generate a podcast script using AI."""
    # Render the prompt template with the provided summary
    task = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.render(combined_summary=combined_summary)

    try:
        # Use the client (likely Cohere's AI) to generate the podcast script
        response = client.messages.create(
            response_model=PodcastScript,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task}],
            temperature=0,
        )

        return response
    except instructor.InstructorRetryException as e:
        print(f"Error generating podcast script: {str(e)}")
        print("Raw response:")
        print(e.last_completion)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

### Validate and Save Script

```python
def validate_podcast_script(script: PodcastScript):
    """Validate the generated podcast script."""
    assert script.persona == "host", "Persona must be 'host'"
    assert script.voice == "Ruth", "Voice must be 'Ruth'"
    assert len(script.text) > 0, "Script must not be empty"
    assert any("welcome" in line.lower() for line in script.text[:5]), "Script must start with a welcome message"
    assert any("thank" in line.lower() for line in script.text[-5:]), "Script must end with a thank you message"

def save_podcast_script(podcast_script, filename='podcast_script.json'):
    """Save the generated script to a JSON file."""
    if podcast_script is None:
        print("Warning: Podcast script is None, skipping save operation.")
        return

    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(podcast_script.model_dump(), f, indent=2)
        print(f"Podcast script saved to {filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to save podcast script: {e}")
        raise
```

*Generating a structured and validated script ensures your podcast maintains a consistent and professional quality.*

## 4. Automating Podcast Creation: Converting Scripts to Audio

### Convert Script to Speech with Eleven Labs

```python
def generate_podcast_audio(script_file, output_file="Final_Podcast.wav", api_key=None):
    """Convert the script to audio using ElevenLabs API."""
    if not api_key:
        api_key = os.environ.get("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("ElevenLabs API key is required. Set it as an environment variable or pass it as an argument.")

    with open(script_file, 'r') as json_file:
        podcast_script = json.load(json_file)

    os.makedirs('temp_audio', exist_ok=True)
    audio_files = []
    voice_id = "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL"

    for i, text in enumerate(podcast_script["text"]):
        temp_file = f'temp_audio/segment_{i}.mp3'
        url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}"
        headers = {
            "Accept": "audio/mpeg",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "xi-api-key": api_key
        }
        data = {
            "text": text,
            "model_id": "eleven_monolingual_v1",
            "voice_settings": {
                "stability": 0.71,
                "similarity_boost": 0.5,
                "style": 0.0,
                "use_speaker_boost": True
            }
        }

        response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            with open(temp_file, "wb") as f:
                f.write(response.content)
            audio_files.append(temp_file)
        else:
            print(f"Error generating audio for segment {i}: {response.status_code}")

    combined = AudioSegment.empty()
    for audio_file in audio_files:
        segment = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_file)
        combined += segment
        combined += AudioSegment.silent(duration=500)

    combined.export(output_file, format="wav")

    for audio_file in audio_files:
        os.remove(audio_file)
    os.rmdir('temp_audio')

    print(f"Podcast audio generated: {output_file}")
    print(f"Duration: {len(combined) / 1000:.2f} seconds")
    return output_file
```

*Converting your script into high-quality audio is a pivotal step in making your podcast accessible and engaging.*

    Args:
    podcast_path (str): Path to the input podcast file.
    output_path (str): Path where the output file will be saved.
    music_url (str): URL of the YouTube video to use as background music.
    
    Returns:
    str: Path of the output file with background music added.
    """
    from moviepy.editor import AudioFileClip, CompositeAudioClip, concatenate_audioclips

    subprocess.run(["yt-dlp", "-x", "--audio-format", "wav", "-o", "BGM.%(ext)s", music_url], check=True)

    if not os.path.exists(podcast_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Podcast file not found: {podcast_path}")

    podcast = AudioFileClip(podcast_path)
    music = AudioFileClip("BGM.wav").volumex(0.12)

    if music.duration < podcast.duration:
        music = music.loop(duration=podcast.duration + 10)

    intro_music = music.subclip(0, 5)
    final_audio = concatenate_audioclips([
        intro_music,
        CompositeAudioClip([podcast, music.subclip(5)])
    ])

    final_audio = final_audio.subclip(0, podcast.duration + 10)
    final_audio = final_audio.audio_fadeout(5)
    final_audio.to_audiofile(output_path, codec='libmp3lame')

    os.remove("BGM.wav")

    print(f"Background music added: {output_path}")
    return output_path
```

*Adding background music not only enhances the listening experience but also adds a professional touch to your podcast.*
